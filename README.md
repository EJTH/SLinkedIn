SLinkedIn
=========
* 2013   Elias Toft Hansen    @    HR-Skyen ApS
* 
* Having problems with older 3rd party linkedin API's we decided
* that it was about time we migrated to OAuth2 and rewrote a proper sturdy 
* integration we could use in our HR Management software.
* 
* This code is a cURL enabled OOP version of the OAuth2 PHP examples found on
* http://developer.linkedin.com/documents/code-samples
* 
* Requirements:
*  + PHP 5
*  + cURL extension
*  + OAuth2 API key and secret for LinkedIn
* 
*
